# Listen to this! - Sonification of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation Attribution Maps for Explainable Audio Classification

This repository contains the code of the work "Listen to this! - Sonification of Layer-Wise Relevance Propagation Attribution Maps for Explainable Audio Classification" by Giulia Di Fede, Gabriele Tomatis, and Giacomo Zuliani.

This paper tackles the challenge of explainability in audio classification, specifically focusing on music genre recognition. We propose a novel approach that enhances explainability by sonifying the attribution maps generated by Layer-wise Relevance Propagation (LRP) on a Vision Transformer (ViT) model. This allows users to listen to the specific audio segments deemed most significant by the model for genre classification. We validate the plausibility of our sonification approach through a user study, demonstrating its effectiveness in highlighting crucial musical features like instrument presence, melody, and intensity changes, surpassing spectrogram annotation in enhancing explainability.
